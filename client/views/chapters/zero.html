      <h2>
         Chapter 0:
         <small>Getting Set Up</small>
      </h2>

      <p>
         As I've mentioned before, the primary goal of Meteor Academy is to get you
         (and me!) to rapidly increase what Hacker School calls one's <q>code radius.</q>
         We'll start out with simple, twitter-like apps and continue to add complexity
         until we get to a basic content management system!
      </p>

      <p>
         Hm.  Is there such a thing as a <q>basic</q> content managament system?  Well,
         I guess we'll find out how it goes with Meteor!
      </p>

      <p>
         However, before we can get to the good stuff, let's make sure we've got the
         tools and know-how to get going.
      </p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>

      <p>
         NOTE:  The bolded text are links to the tools you'll need to get through
         these tutorials.  Since you're on the internet, I trust you'll look up
         installation instructions where necessary ʕ•ᴥ-ʔ.
      </p>

      <ul>
         <li>
            <h4>Text Editor</h4>

            <p>
               If you don't already have a favorite text editor, I highly recommend
               <a href="http://atom.io" target="_blank">Atom</a>.  It's a well
               maintained, highly customizable open-source text editor with an active
               community behind it.
            </p>
         </li>

         <li>
            <h4>Node.js</h4>

            <p>
               Meteor is built on top of <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, a
               platform for developing applications using JavaScript on the server side.
               You'll be needing that.
            </p>
         </li>

         <li>
            <h4>npm</h4>

            <p>
               <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/" target="_blank">npm</a> is a command-line
               utility for adding code packages (modules) to Node.js applications.
            </p>

            <p>
               While not <em>required</em> for building web applications with
               Meteor, npm comes packaged with Node.js.  We can even use npm packages
               in our Meteor applications (more on that later)!
            </p>
         </li>

         <li>
            <h4>Meteor</h4>

            <p>
               Painfully obvious, I know, but you're going to need the latest version of
               <a href="http://meteor.com" target="_blank">Meteor</a> to get through the
               Meteor Academy tutorials.  At the time of this writing, that's version 0.8.3.
            </p>

            <p>
               Famously, once you have Node.js installed, you can install Meteor with a
               single command: <code>$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh</code>
            </p>

            <p>But we're not quite done yet!</p>
         </li>

         <li>
            <h4>Meteorite</h4>

            <p>
               Basically, <a href="http://oortcloud.github.io/meteorite/" target="_blank">Meteorite</a>
               is to Meteor as npm is to Node.js &mdash; a command-line utility
               for adding third-party <q>smart packages</q> to your Meteor applications.
            </p>

            <p>
               Why <q>third-party</q>?  Because Meteor already comes with a neat set of
               smart packages to get you started building applications right away.  But
               while the Meteor Development Group is busy releasing new versions of Meteor
               about once a month, the community stepped up to enable even greater
               functionality!
            </p>

            <p>
               <a href="http://atmospherejs.com/" target="_blank">Atmosphere</a> is the
               catalogue where you'll find smart packages available for download via Meteorite.
            </p>
         </li>

         <li>
            <h4>Meteor Developer Account</h4>

            <p>
               Okay, so you don't <em>need</em> a Meteor Developer account to get started
               with Meteor, but it does have some added benefits.  For one, you can enable
               only those with Meteor Developer Accounts to login to your applications.
               And secondly, once Atmosphere is officially a part of Meteor, I believe
               one's developer account will be used for installing smart packages.
            </p>

            <p>So claim your name while you still can!</p>
         </li>

         <li>
            <h4>Git</h4>
         </li>

         <li>
            <h4>GitHub</h4>
         </li>

         <li>
            <h4>Patience</h4>
            <p>
               I know the internet told you Meteor is super easy to learn.  And maybe it
               is if you have extensive experience with other web development frameworks.
               But Meteor Academy doesn't assume you do.  So perhaps we'll start out a
               little slowly, but I'll do my best to make sure you can skip ahead to
               your appropriate skill level without losing context.
            </p>
